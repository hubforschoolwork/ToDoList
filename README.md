<h1>To Do List App</h1>

Felicia Jimenez

This is a basic To Do List/Contact Form application.

<ul>
<li>The To Do List feature allows users to enter up to a maximum of 7 task items.</li>
<li>These task items can be added, marked as completed, deleted and toggled back to "active" status.</li>
<li>As the task list is front and center upon opening the app, no additional "buttons" or navigation are necessary, as status is easy to view "at a glance".</li>
<li>The Contact Form is short, but includes all the essential fields as expected.</li>
<li>The app uses the following:  React, HTML and CSS.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The app has room to grow and the following improvements would be a good place to start:</li>
    <li>Contact Form:  Add a feature where the contacts can be stored and retrieved as needed.</li>  
    <li>Color-Code Task Items by Category:  Red = urgent; blue = not urgent; yellow = deadline approaching.</li>
    <li>Notifications:  If tasks were entered along with an optional "due date", the user could request a notification in advance of the due date.</li>
    <li>Increase the number of tasks that can be input beyond the 7 task maximum.  This would include adjustments to the size of the container as well.</li>
</ul>
